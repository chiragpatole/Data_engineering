Project: End-to-End Data Pipeline Implementation

Description:
Developed a comprehensive data pipeline utilizing Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to orchestrate data workflows from ingestion to analysis. Leveraged Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, particularly BigQuery, for efficient data warehousing and storage.

Implemented dynamic dashboard functionality to visualize insights derived from the Titanic passenger dataset.

Highlights:

Designed and executed Apache Airflow DAGs to streamline data processing tasks, ensuring smooth flow from data ingestion to transformation and analysis.
Utilized GCP's BigQuery for robust data warehousing, enabling scalable storage and efficient querying of large datasets.
Implemented a dynamic dashboard to visualize key insights and trends extracted from the Titanic passenger dataset, enhancing data-driven decision-making capabilities.
This project demonstrated proficiency in data engineering, cloud computing, and dashboard development, showcasing the ability to create end-to-end solutions for complex data challenges.
